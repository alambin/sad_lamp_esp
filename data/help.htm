        <p align="justify">This is SAD-Lamp Web interface. You can configure SAD-Lamp, change its settings,
          upload firmware to ESP and main board, etc.</p>
        <p>Normally hardware serial port of ESP is connected to hardware serial port of Arduino, which makes impossible
          to use logs via USB. Because of that you can use "Debug log" page to get logs from both: ESP and Arduino</p>
        <p>Use "File Upload" to upload/delete/edit files to ESP using Web-UI.</p>
        <p>
          You can also establish FTP connection to SAD-Lamp, but there are some limitations:
          <ul style="margin-top: -10px; margin-left: -20px;">
            <li>You need to setup Filezilla(or other FTP client) to only allow 1 connection</li>
            <li>Encryption is NOT supported, so you'll have to disable it in FTP client</li>
            <li>Currently FTP connection is unstable</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <b>Note</b>
        <ul style="margin-top: 2px; margin-left: -20px;">
          <li>When flashing ESP via Arduino IDE you should choose Tools -> Flash Size-> "1MB (FS:128KB .....). You need
            to have at least 128 KB for file system on ESP. If you will add more files to ESP, you will probably need to
            choose option with bigger file system size."</li>
          <li>To flash ESP file system via Arduino IDE, you should choose Tools -> ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload. It will
            take "data" subfolder from folder of your sketch and copy its content to SPIFFS of ESP</li>
          <li>When you flash firmware or code to ESP via USB adapter, you need to change switch to "PROG" position. Also
            you need to unplug it and plug again before each flashing.</li>
          <li>By default when ESP doesn't have any WiFi settings, it creates its own WiFi access point with name
            "SAD-Lamp_AP". You should connect to it (ex. using mobile phone) and provide WiFi settings (access point
            name and password)</li>
