        <p align="justify">This is SAD-Lamp Web interface. You can configure SAD-Lamp, change its settings,
          upload firmware to ESP and main board, etc.</p>
        <p>Normally hardware serial port of ESP is connected to hardware serial port of Arduino, which makes impossible
          to use logs via USB. Because of that you can use "Debug log" page to get logs from both: ESP and Arduino</p>
        <p>Use "File Upload" to upload/delete/edit files to ESP using Web-UI.</p>
        <p>
          You can also establish FTP connection to SAD-Lamp, but there are some limitations:
          <ul style="margin-top: -10px; margin-left: -20px;">
            <li>You need to setup Filezilla(or other FTP client) to only allow 1 connection</li>
            <li>Encryption is NOT supported, so you'll have to disable it in FTP client</li>
            <li>Currently FTP connection is unstable</li>
          </ul>
