      <td class="Help" style="text-align: justify;">
        <p>This is SAD-Lamp Web interface. You can configure SAD-Lamp, change its settings,
          upload firmware to ESP and main board, etc.</p>
        <br>

        <b>Wi-Fi</b>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px;">By default when ESP doesn't have any WiFi settings, it creates
          its own WiFi access point with name "SAD-Lamp_AP". You should connect to it (ex. using mobile phone) and
          provide WiFi settings (access point name and password)</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px;"><b>Note!</b> By some reason on some old WiFi routers when ESP connects to WiFi,
          it ruins WiFi. This is hardware issue of ESP. Because of that, it is recommended to connect SAD-Lamp (as any
          other IoT devices) to separate WiFi router.</p>
        <br>

        <b>SAD-Lamp modes</b>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px;">SAD-Lamp can work in one of two modes: automatic or manual.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px;">If user moves handle (potentiometer) to set some brightness, it
          is treated as manual mode. In this mode it is impossible to have sunrise effect or set brightness via WebUI.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px;">If user switches handle to fixed zero position or moves it close to zero position,
          it is treated as automatic mode. If nothing happens, SAD-Lamp will keep being turned off. But if' let's say,
          time of alarm comes, then in this mode SAD-Lamp runs sunrise effect. Moreover, in this mode user can set
          brightness via WebUI.</p>
        <br>

        <b>ESP and Arduino modules</b>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px;">SAD-Lamp has 2 modules (boards):</p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 2px; margin-left: -20px;">
          <li>ESP-01. This module runs Web-Server and WebUI on it. It has some files for WebUI (.html, .js, etc.). You
            can update those files over the air (refer to "File uploading"). It is connected to Arduino module via
            hardware serial port (because of that you can not use USB for debugging, when two modules are connected
            together, for details refer to "Debugging"). ESP module is able to update its own firmware over the air. It
            is also able to update formware of Arduino module over the air. To run OTA update use "Settings" page.</li>
          <li>Arduino Nano. This module executes actual control of SAD-Lamp's LEDs brightness, handles user input (via
            potentiometer), runs sunrise effect, tracks current temperature of LEDs to avoid overheating, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <b>Reset ESP to default settings</b>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px;">It is possible that WiFi settings are outdated or user configured them in wrong way
          and WebUI is not accessible. In this case you can reset ESP settings to default (ex. WiFi settings). Normally
          you can do it via WebUI but if you don't have access to it, you need to use handle on lamp (potentiometer) and
          switch 5 times between automatic and manual modes. You should turn on each mode for 2-4 seconds.</p>
        <br>

        <b>File uploading</b>
        <ul style="margin-top: 2px; margin-left: -20px;">
          <li>Use "File Upload" to upload/delete/edit files to ESP using Web-UI.</li>
          <li>You can also establish FTP connection to SAD-Lamp, but there are some limitations:
            <ul style="margin-top: 0px">
              <li>You need to setup Filezilla(or other FTP client) to only allow 1 connection</li>
              <li>Encryption is NOT supported, so you'll have to disable it in FTP client</li>
              <li>Currently FTP connection is unstable</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <b>Flashing</b>
        <ul style="margin-top: 2px; margin-left: -20px;">
          <li>When flashing ESP via Arduino IDE you should choose Tools -> Flash Size-> "1MB (FS:128KB .....). You
            need to have at least 128 KB for file system on ESP. If you will add more files to ESP, you will probably
            need to choose option with bigger file system size."</li>
          <li>To flash ESP file system via Arduino IDE, you should choose Tools -> ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload. It will
            take "data" subfolder from folder of your sketch and copy its content to SPIFFS of ESP</li>
          <li>When you flash firmware or code to ESP via USB adapter, you need to change switch to "PROG" position.
            Also you need to unplug it and plug again before each flashing.</li>
          <li>To generate binary for choosen sketch (Arduino or ESP firmware), in Arduino IDE choose Stetch -> Export
            Compiled Binary. It will generate binary in root folder of selected sketch.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <b>Debugging</b>
        <p style="margin-top: 2px;">Normally hardware serial port of ESP is connected to hardware serial port of
          Arduino, which makes impossible to use logs via USB. Because of that you can use "Debug log" page to get
          logs from both: ESP and Arduino</p>
        <br>

        <b>Arduino supported commands:</b>
        <ul style="margin-top: 3px; margin-left: -20px;">
          <li>"ESP: st HH:MM:SS DD/MM/YYYY" - set current time</li>
          <li>"ESP: gt" - get current time (HH:MM:SS DD/MM/YYYY)</li>
          <li>"ESP: sa HH:MM WW" - set alarm on specified time (WW - day of week mask, hex)</li>
          <li>"ESP: ga" - get alarm (E HH:MM WW, E = "E" if alarm enabled, "D" if disabled)</li>
          <li>"ESP: ea E" enable alarm (if E = "E", enable alarm, if E = "D", disable)</li>
          <li>"ESP: ta" toggle alarm On/Off</li>
          <li>"ESP: ssd MMMM" set Sunrise duration in minutes (0-1440)</li>
          <li>"ESP: gsd" get Sunrise duration (MMMM)</li>
          <li>"ESP: sb BBBB" set brightness (0-1023). Not allowed in manual lamp control mode</li>
          <li>"ESP: gb" get current brightness (M BBBB, M = "M" if lamp in manual mode, "A" - in automatic mode)
          </li>
          <li>"ESP: sff FF" set fan PWM frequency (used only for DOUT PWM)</li>
          <li>"ESP: sfs NN" set fan PWM steps number (steps per PWM period) (used only for DOUT PWM)</li>
        </ul>
